I'm building out a mock-up for a generic coffee house, based on Ryan's dribble shot. 

My goal is to utilize HTML5 for my markup and CSS3 for my styling. I would like to incorporate some DOM manipulation utilizing JavaScript. 

I will continue to add notes as I go.

## Article of Inspiration
The article below, assured me that what I am doing right now is the right thing, learn HTML and CSS from the roots. Granted I am or will be using tools such as Flexbox and possibly Grid, which has helped in simplifying the styling process, but I am still not relying on a framework. To this I must say, thank you Racel Andrew and the many others who have forged the way in the world of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
